<h2>Project 2: News Website (200 points) </h2>
<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>For this project you will create a website that incorporates feeds and posts (Think blogs or news websites). The challenge will be to design an interface that incorporates (mock) functionality like sharing, liking, and comments, as well as scale. Will your interface accommodate hundreds of articles? Will your template design support long titles or comments? Also consider how you will incorporate dates and author attribution. For additional authenticity, you might incorporate a <a href="https://schema.org/" target="_blank">Schema structure</a>.</p>
<p>The subject matter is up to you, but your research should reflect your theme. Once again, to optimize your time, consider using <a href="/resources/images-icons/">stock images</a>.</p>
<h3>Development Requirements:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Your Figma design should be <a href="https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040314193-Guide-to-prototyping-in-Figma">interactive</a>.</li>
  <li>Using what you learn in Exercise 5, this project should be created using <a href="https://astro.build/" target="_blank">Astro</a>.</li>
  <li>Given the material, you should be using the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_article.asp" target="_blank">article</a> tag.</li>
  <li>No page count, but your site should have multiple articles with the ability to scale</li>
  <li>You will be required to export your Figma file as a PDF</li>
  <li>Your finished project should be at yoursite.com/projects/project-2</li>
</ol>
<h3>Process:</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Content.</strong>You will assemble all of the content to be displayed in your site.</li>
  <li><strong>Sitemap/Wireframing.</strong> You will develop a sitemap outlining the sections of your site, which will then be expanded further during a wireframe phase.</li>

  <li><strong>Design Critique.</strong> You will take part in an in-class design critique where you will provide constructive criticism to your classmates on their designs, as well as receive feedback on yours.</li>
  <li><strong>Development.</strong> You will proceed to develop the website on your local machine. Upon completion, it will be uploaded to your website.</li>
  <li><strong>Final Critique.</strong> You will participate in a final group critique where we review each of the project.</li>
