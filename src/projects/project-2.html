<h2>Event Promotion Website (200 points)</h2>
<h3>Project Description:</h3>
<p>
  You will create a responsive and interactive design for a mock event website.
  The venue, event information, and details are up to you--It can be a concert,
  technical conference, etc.
</p>
<p>
  Your designs should include two interactive piecesâ€”one for desktop (up to
  1920px width) and one for mobile (320px width to represent portrait mode on
  mobile devices). Your Figma designs should be using components, text styles,
  and color variables.
</p>
<p>
  For development, you will partner with another student in which you will swap
  projects--they will build your project and you will build theirs. Your grade
  will be based on how well you execute their design. The finished responsive
  site should be built using Astro.

    critique where you will provide constructive criticism to your classmates on
    their designs, as well as receive feedback on yours.

    address improvements uncovered during the critique.
