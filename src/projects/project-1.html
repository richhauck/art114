<h2>Social Media Prototype Site (180 points)</h2>
<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>What if your client needed an interactive walkthrough of an application with a higher fidelity than Figma? What if they wanted to impress potential investors with the HTML foundation of an application? <br>
  <br>
This isn't an uncommon request in the real world. a</p>
<p>Yo are being tasked with creating the branding and design for a social media site that allows for the sharing, commenting, and uploading of images. Consider this as if it were a tool as a part of a sales pitch for building a website along the lines of <a href="Instagram.com" target="_blank">Instagram.com</a>, <a href="https://www.flickr.com" target="_blank">Flickr.com</a>, <a href="https://www.behance.net/" target="_blank">Behance.net</a>, <a href="https://dribbble.com/" target="_blank">Dribbble.com</a>, etc. The name, branding, and specific nature of the site&rsquo;s theme are up to you. Will it be for sharing photography? Illustration? Design?</p>
<p>A site of this nature could potentially scale to thousands of pages with many users, so your responsibility will be to identify major page templates used by the site and create a site that someone can navigate through. At a minimum, you will probably need:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Homepage</li>
  <li>User Profile Page</li>
  <li>Upload Page</li>
  <li>Search/Browse Images</li>
  <li>Individual Image Page</li>
</ul>
<p>The design should include &ldquo;like&rdquo; buttons, tagging, commenting, and login/logout indications. You will also need to consider the naming conventions and organization of your CSS. Consider <a href="https://getbem.com/" target="_blank">BEM</a> or another naming convention. </p>
<p>While the finished site should be visually polished, it needn&rsquo;t be fully functional. For instance, you could place an image upload or comment form, but the forms won&rsquo;t actually function. For the images themselves, you can use placeholder services such as <a href="http://pravatar.cc" target="_blank">http://pravatar.cc</a> or <a href="https://loremfaces.com/" target="_blank">https://loremfaces.com</a> for avatars and <a href="https://placeimg.com" target="_blank">https://placeimg.com</a> or <a href="https://stablediffusionweb.com/" target="_blank">https://stablediffusionweb.com/</a> for mock photo uploads. For mock comments, lorem ipsum is fine. <br>
</p>
<h3>Development Requirements:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>While not fully-functioning, the site should be easy to navigate, responsive, and published to your website.</li>
  <li>It should be clear what portions of the site are not functional/disabled. Consider creating a disabled class that makes the UI opaque and disabled cursor events.</li>
  <li>The site must utilize a favicon.</li>
  <li>The site must contain a table (consider it for comments).</li>
  <li>The current page should be highlighted in the responsive navigation.</li>
  <li>Website should contain proper page titles for SEO.</li>
  <li>The site should incorporate JavaScript in some way--consider a dark/light toggle, favorite button that maintains state, or a Lightbox.</li>
  <li>The site should incorporate server-side includes with PHP.</li>
</ul>
