  <h2>What is WordPress?</h2>
  <p>
    WordPress is the most popular Content Management System (CMS) currently
    running on the web, with about
    <a href="https://firstsiteguide.com/cms-stats/#wordpress"
      >41 percent market share</a
    >. WordPress achieved this because, unlike competitors like Wix and
    SquareSpace, it offers the PHP code for free, meaning anyone can download
    the open source code and choose to host it wherever they want. The company
    behind WordPress is <a href="https://automattic.com/">Automattic</a>, and
    they run:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://wordpress.com/">WordPress.com</a> (the commercial arm which
      offers hosting and support) and
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://wordpress.org">WordPress.org</a> (which hosts documentation,
      community resources, and the open source software).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Running WordPress Locally</h2>
  <p>
    To run WordPress on your own computer, we will use
    <a href="https://developer.wordpress.com/studio/">WordPress Studio</a>,
    which is a software that makes it easy to locally host a PHP/MySQL
    environment to run WordPress.

  <h2>Themes and Plugins</h2>
  <p>
    Part of the popularity of WordPress comes from the fact that it can extended
    with themes and plugins.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Themes</strong> change the appearance of your WordPress website. Besides
    the themes
    <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/">themes on WordPress.org</a>, there
    are several other for-pay sites on the web (for instance,
    <a href="https://www.elegantthemes.com/gallery/divi/">Divi</a> is a theme that
    allows you to customize with a visual interface in the admin).
