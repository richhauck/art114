    PHP is a popular open source server-side scripting language. You can learn
    more via the <a href="http://us3.php.net/manual/en/">PHP Manual</a> or on
    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_includes.asp">W3Schools</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Using PHP file includes can significantly cut down the amount of code in
    your page templates. For instance, rather than incorporating header and
    footer HTML code in each page on your site, you could instead include a
    single file representing those pieces into your pages.
  </p>
  <p>
    To use PHP, files must have a .php file extension and any PHP code must
    reside in PHP tags (example below).
  </p>
  <p>
    PHP requires a server to interpret the code, so you can't simply open it in
    a browser like an HTML page. For this reason, we will use
    <a href="https://www.mamp.info/en/">MAMP</a> locally (PHP will work automatically
    when you upload it to your website, since your shared hosting server runs PHP).
  </p>
  <p>
    Consider a scenario where you have a simple three-page site with home,
    about, and contact pages. You have already built your page template in HTML
    and CSS, and all three pages share will share the same header and footer.
    Rather than maintain redundant markup, you could organize it with PHP like
    so:
  </p>

  <div class="box">
    <pre>
    index.php
    about.php
    contact.php
    /inc
      - header.php
      - footer.php
  </pre>
  </div>

  <p>Here's the code for the pages:</p>

  <h2>inc/header.php</h2>
  <Code
    lang="php"
    code=`<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title><?php echo $title;?> | My Website</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <main>
      <nav>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="/index.php">Home</a></li>
          <li><a href="/about.php">About</a></li>
          <li><a href="/contact.php">Contact</a></li>
        </ul>
      </nav>
      <hr />
      <h1><?php echo $title;?></h1>

      <h2>inc/footer.php</h2>
      
    </main>
  </body>
</html>`
  />

  <p>
    Notice we're opening HTML tags in header.php that we're closing in
    footer.php. We're letting PHP put the page together for us before it hits
    the browser.
  </p>

  <h2>index.php</h2>
  <Code
    lang="php"
    code=`
<?php
  $title = "Home";
  include 'inc/header.php';
?>
<p>Page content goes here</p>
<?php include 'inc/footer.php'; ?>
`
  />

  <h2>about.php</h2>
  <Code
    lang="php"
    code=`
<?php
$title = "About";
include 'inc/header.php';
?>
<?php include 'inc/footer.php'; ?>
`
  />

  <h2>contact.php</h2>
  <Code
    lang="php"
    code=`
<?php
$title = "Contact";
include 'inc/header.php';
?>
<?php include 'inc/footer.php'; ?>
`
  />

  <p>
    Notice that since the page title is something that will change across pages
    we define it as a variable at the top of each page in PHP. When the
    header.php file loads, it injects the value into the title and h1 tags.
  </p>

  <h2>File includes in subdirectories</h2>
  <p>
    This will work with pages in folders, as well. For instance, imagine you
    added a "projects" folder. The folder structure would look like this:
  </p>

  <div class="box">
    <pre>
    index.php
    about.php
    contact.php
    /projects
      - index.php
    /inc
      - header.php
      - footer.php
  </pre>
  </div>

  <p>Your projects/index.php page might look like this:</p>

  <Code
    lang="php"
    code=`
<?php
$title = "Projects";
include '../inc/header.php';
?>
<?php include '../inc/footer.php'; ?>
`
  />

  <p>
    Notice that the path to the include files just has to go up a directory.
  </p>

  <h2>Resolving the path issue in subdirectories</h2>
  <p>In the step above, linking to pages with a leading slash like this:</p>
  <Code lang="html" code=`
<a href="/projects/index.php">Projects</a>
` />

  <p>
    tells the browser to go to the topmost directory of your site to find your
    page. This works fine if your page is at
    <em>yourwebsite.com/projects/index.php</em>, but fails if you've nested the
    folder somewhere like <em>yourwebsite.com/exercises/projects/index.php</em>.
    While we could resolve it by making an explicit link: <Code
      lang="html"
      code=`
  <a href="https://yourwebsite.com/projects/index.php">Projects</a>
  `
    />
  </p>
  <p>
    That's inefficient as our link now has to go out to the web, only to be
    returned to its site.
  </p>
  <p>
    A better way to resolve this issue is to define a path variable before your
    include files (similar to how we defined $title, above). For instance, in
    your projects page, you might define it like this:
  </p>

  <Code
    lang="php"
    code=`
<?php
$title = "Projects";
$basePath = "../";

include $basePath . 'inc/header.php';
?>
<?php include $basePath . 'inc/footer.php'; ?>
`
  />

  <p>
    Here, we've created a variable called <strong>$basePath</strong> that stores
    the relative path to the top directory of this microsite. Then, we revise the
    header to inject this variable wherever we need it:
  </p>
  <Code
    lang="php"
    code=`
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title><?php echo $title;?> | My Website</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <main>
      <nav>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="<?php echo $basePath;?>index.php">Home</a></li>
          <li><a href="<?php echo $basePath;?>about.php">About</a></li>
          <li><a href="<?php echo $basePath;?>contact.php">Contact</a></li>
        </ul>
      </nav>
      <hr />
      <h1><?php echo $title;?></h1>
`
  />

  <p>
    Now, each of these links will go to the relative top directory of the site
    as opposed to the top directory of the domain.
  </p>
