  <h3>API - Designing Around Data</h3>
  <p>
    Fetch data from an API and render the results of your request to an HTML
    page. Your final HTML page should be published at by next class.
  </p>
  <p>
    Reference the <a href={`${import.meta.env.BASE_URL}resources/apis/`}
      >API examples shown in class</a
    >, but your assignment cannot be a copy of one of these examples. Choose a
    different endpoint and/or output different content.
  </p>
  <p>
    The API source is up to you. Consider the Library of Congress API, which has
    <a href="https://www.loc.gov/apis/json-and-yaml/requests/endpoints/"
      >extensive documentation</a
    >. Alternatively, you could choose from from this list of
    <a href="https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis">Public APIs</a>. Do
    note that APIs typically require authentication (for accountability). If you
    choose one that has Auth, you may need to register for access.
  </p>

  <p>
    Use CSS to make a responsive design for the data you have loaded. Your final
    HTML page should be published at by next class.
  </p>
