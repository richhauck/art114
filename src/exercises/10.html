<h3>API - Designing Around Data</h3>
<p>
    Fetch data from an API and render the results of your request to an HTML
    page. Your final HTML page should be published at by next class.
  </p>
  <p>Reference the <a href="{{ "/resources/apis/" | url }}">API examples shown in class</a>, but your assignment cannot be a copy of one of these examples. Choose a different endpoint and/or output different content.</p>
  <p>
    The API source is up to you. Consider the Library of
    Congress API, which has
    <a href="https://www.loc.gov/apis/json-and-yaml/requests/endpoints/"
      >extensive documentation</a
    >. Alternatively, you could choose from from this list of
    <a href="https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis">Public APIs</a>. Do note that APIs typically require authentication (for
    accountability). If you choose one that has Auth, you may need to register
    for access.</p>
  
<p>
  Use CSS to make a responsive design for the data you have loaded. Your final HTML page should be
  published at by next class.
