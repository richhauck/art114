<h3>API - Loading Data</h3>
<p>
  Fetch data from an API and render the results of your request to an HTML
  page. Your final HTML page should be published at
  <em>yoursite.com/assignments/assignment-7</em> by next class.
</p>
<p>Definitely use the <a href="{{ "/resources/apis/" | url }}">API examples shown in class</a>, but your assignment cannot be a copy of one of these examples. Choose a different endpoint and/or output different content.</p>
<p>
  The API source is up to you. Consider the Library of
  Congress API, which has
  <a href="https://www.loc.gov/apis/json-and-yaml/requests/endpoints/"
    >extensive documentation</a
  >. Alternatively, you could choose from from this list of
  <a href="https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis">Public APIs</a>. Do note that APIs typically require authentication (for
  accountability). If you choose one that has Auth, you may need to register
  for access.</p>
