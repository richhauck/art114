title: File Includes in PHP
---

<p>
  PHP is a popular open source server-side scripting language. You can learn
  more via the <a href="http://us3.php.net/manual/en/">PHP Manual</a> or on
  <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_includes.asp">W3Schools</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Using PHP file includes can significantly cut down the amount of code in your
  page templates. For instance, rather than incorporating header and footer HTML
  code in each page on your site, you could instead include a single file
  representing those pieces into your pages.
</p>
<p>
  To use PHP, files must have a .php file extension and any PHP code must reside
  in PHP tags (example below).
</p>
<p>
  PHP requires a server to interpret the code, so you can't simply open it in a
  browser like an HTML page. For this reason, we will use
  <a href="https://www.mamp.info/en/">MAMP</a> locally (PHP will work
  automatically when you upload it to your website, since your shared hosting
  server runs PHP).
</p>
<p>
  Consider a scenario where you have a simple three-page site with home, about,
  and contact pages. You have already built your page template in HTML and CSS,
  and all three pages share will share the same header and footer. Rather than
  maintain redundant markup, you could organize it with PHP like so:
</p>

<div class="box">
  <pre>
    index.php
    about.php
    contact.php
    /inc
      - header.php
      - footer.php
  </pre>
</div>

<p>Here's the code for the pages:</p>

<h2>inc/header.php</h2>
{%highlight "php" %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title><?php echo $title;?> | My Website</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <main>
      <nav>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="/index.php">Home</a></li>
          <li><a href="/about.php">About</a></li>
          <li><a href="/contact.php">Contact</a></li>
        </ul>
      </nav>
      <hr />
      <h1><?php echo $title;?></h1>
      {% endhighlight %}

      <h2>inc/footer.php</h2>
      {%highlight "php" %}
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  Notice we're opening HTML tags in header.php that we're closing in footer.php.
  We're letting PHP put the page together for us before it hits the browser.
</p>

<h2>index.php</h2>
{%highlight "php" %}
<?php
  $title = "Home";
  include 'inc/header.php';
?>
<p>Page content goes here</p>
<?php include 'inc/footer.php'; ?>
{% endhighlight %}

<h2>about.php</h2>
{%highlight "php" %}
<?php
$title = "About";
include 'inc/header.php';
?>
<?php include 'inc/footer.php'; ?>
{% endhighlight %}

<h2>contact.php</h2>
{%highlight "php" %}
<?php
$title = "Contact";
include 'inc/header.php';
?>
<?php include 'inc/footer.php'; ?>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  Notice that since the page title is something that will change across pages we
  define it as a variable at the top of each page in PHP. When the header.php
  file loads, it injects the value into the title and h1 tags.
</p>

<h2>File includes in subdirectories</h2>
<p>
  This will work with pages in folders, as well. For instance, imagine you added
  a "projects" folder. The folder structure would look like this:
</p>

<div class="box">
  <pre>
    index.php
    about.php
    contact.php
    /projects
      - index.php
    /inc
      - header.php
      - footer.php
  </pre>
</div>

<p>Your projects/index.php page might look like this:</p>

{%highlight "php" %}
<?php
$title = "Projects";
include '../inc/header.php';
?>
<?php include '../inc/footer.php'; ?>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Notice that the path to the include files just has to go up a directory.</p>

<h2>Resolving the path issue in subdirectories</h2>
<p>In the step above, linking to pages with a leading slash like this:</p>
{%highlight "html" %}
<a href="/projects/index.php">Projects</a>
{%endhighlight%}

<p>
  tells the browser to go to the topmost directory of your site to find your
  page. This works fine if your page is at
  <em>yourwebsite.com/projects/index.php</em>, but fails if you've nested the
  folder somewhere like <em>yourwebsite.com/exercises/projects/index.php</em>.
  While we could resolve it by making an explicit link: {%highlight "html" %}
  <a href="https://yourwebsite.com/projects/index.php">Projects</a>
  {%endhighlight%}
</p>
<p>
  That's inefficient as our link now has to go out to the web, only to be
  returned to its site.
</p>
<p>
  A better way to resolve this issue is to define a path variable before your
  include files (similar to how we defined $title, above). For instance, in your
  projects page, you might define it like this:
</p>

{%highlight "php" %}
<?php
$title = "Projects";
$basePath = "../";

include $basePath . 'inc/header.php';
?>
<?php include $basePath . 'inc/footer.php'; ?>
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
  Here, we've created a variable called <strong>$basePath</strong> that stores
  the relative path to the top directory of this microsite. Then, we revise the
  header to inject this variable wherever we need it:
</p>
{%highlight "php" %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title><?php echo $title;?> | My Website</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <main>
      <nav>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="<?php echo $basePath;?>index.php">Home</a></li>
          <li><a href="<?php echo $basePath;?>about.php">About</a></li>
          <li><a href="<?php echo $basePath;?>contact.php">Contact</a></li>
        </ul>
      </nav>
      <hr />
      <h1><?php echo $title;?></h1>
      {% endhighlight %}

      <p>
        Now, each of these links will go to the relative top directory of the
        site as opposed to the top directory of the domain.
      </p>
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
