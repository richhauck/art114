<h2>What is WordPress?</h2>
<p>
  WordPress is the most popular Content Management System (CMS) currently
  running on the web, with about
  <a href="https://firstsiteguide.com/cms-stats/#wordpress"
    >41 percent market share</a
  >. WordPress achieved this because, unlike competitors like Wix and
  SquareSpace, it offers the PHP code for free, meaning anyone can download the
  open source code and choose to host it wherever they want. The company behind
  WordPress is <a href="https://automattic.com/">Automattic</a>, and they run:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://wordpress.com/">WordPress.com</a> (the commercial arm which
    offers hosting and support) and
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://wordpress.org">WordPress.org</a> (which hosts
    documentation, community resources, and the open source software).
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Running WordPress Locally</h2>
<p>
  To run WordPress on your own computer, we will use
  <a href="https://localwp.com/">Local</a>, which is a software that makes it
  easy to locally host a PHP/MySQL environment to run WordPress.

<h2>Themes and Plugins</h2>
<p>
  Part of the popularity of WordPress comes from the fact that it can extended
  with themes and plugins.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Themes</strong> change the appearance of your WordPress website.
  Besides the themes
  <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/">themes on WordPress.org</a>, there are
  several other for-pay sites on the web (for instance,
  <a href="https://www.elegantthemes.com/gallery/divi/">Divi</a> is a theme that
  allows you to customize with a visual interface in the admin).
</p>
<p>
  <strong><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins">Plugins</a></strong> extend
  the functionality of your WordPress site.

<h2>Custom Theming</h2>
<p>
  Custom themes are a way to have full control over your site design. WordPress
  publishes thorough documentation on custom theme development on their
  <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development">Codex</a> and in their
  <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/">theme handbook</a>.
