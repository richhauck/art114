<p>FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol, and it's a method to upload and download web site files. In order to use FTP, you need an FTP client (or software).</p>
<p>For this class, you can use the free FTP clients <a href="https://filezilla-project.org/" target="_blank">FileZilla</a> or <a href="https://cyberduck.io/" target="_blank">Cyberduck</a>.</p>

  <h2>Folder setup</h2>
  <p>I would recommend creating a "Sites" folder under your user folder on your hard drive, creating the folder structure below, and uploading this folder structure to your server (within /public_html). This folder should be a mirror image of what's on the server, and should not contain production files (AIs, PSDs, etc.).</p>
