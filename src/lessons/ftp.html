<p>
  FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol, and it's a method to upload and
  download web site files. In order to use FTP, you need an FTP client (or
  software).
</p>
<p>
  For this class, you can use the free FTP clients

  <a href="https://cyberduck.io/" target="_blank">Cyberduck</a>.

        These credentials are supplied by your registrar. The username and
        password are typically the same credentials you use to log into your
        registrar.<br />
        <strong>Host</strong>: your domain (ex: yoursite.com)<br />
        <strong>Username</strong>: username assigned by your registrar<br />
        <strong>Password</strong>: Password assigned by your registrar<br />
        <strong>Port</strong>: Can usually be kept blank

        Contents of selected folder on your hard drive--leave everything here
        alone and ONLY NAVIGATE TO YOUR public_html directory. This is your
        website directory. Feel free to delete anything within /public_html
        (/cgi-bin, etc.)

<h2>Folder setup</h2>
<p>
  I would recommend creating a "Sites" folder under your user folder on your
  hard drive, creating the folder structure below, and uploading this folder
  structure to your server (within /public_html). This folder should be a mirror
  image of what's on the server, and should not contain production files (AIs,
  PSDs, etc.).

  <h3>Tips</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Your master FTP account is usually the username/password provided by your
      hosting provider--it's often the same credentials for logging into the
      service.
    </li>
    <li>
      Most hosts allow you to create additional FTP accounts in their control
      panel. You can access this by logging into your host's website.
    </li>
    <li>
      Production files (PSDs, AIs, etc.) should not be a part of the site. These
      files often take up a lot of space and aren't interpreted by a browser.
    </li>
  </ul>
