<h2>Choosing a domain name</h2>
<p>
  Domain names are unique, easy-to-remember addresses for websites on the
  internet. It's a human-friendly equivalent of an IP address. Expect to pay
  ~$12/year for a domain name.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Consider something memorable and SEO-friendly.</li>
  <li>
    Your name is one of the best domains to acquire, as it makes it easy to
    remember, will come up when people search for you, and doesn't paint you in
    a corner when it comes to offerings.
  </li>
  <li>
    Don’t choose a mock business name unless you’ve legally registered using it.
  </li>
  <li>.com remains the most memorable extension.</li>
</ul>

          <li>Multiple websites are hosted on the same server</li>
          <li>
            Shared resources, so high traffic on one site can impact others
          </li>
          <li>
            Less secure, as multiple sites means more entry points for breaches
          </li>
          <li>More affordable</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Single website is hosted on the server</li>
          <li>Better performance</li>
          <li>More secure, as server only hosts one site</li>
          <li>More expensive</li>

        <ul>

            Virtually creates a dedicated server via server software. Can run
            multiple virtual servers on one physical machine

<p>
  For this class, you should be seeking the most affordable shared hosting.
  Avoid hosting on <a href="https://www.wix.com">wix.com</a>,
  <a href="https://www.squarespace.com">Squarespace.com</a>, or
  <a href="https://www.wordpress.com">Wordpress.com</a>, as these all-in-one
  solutions will not give you the features needed for this class.
</p>
<p>Ideally, you’ll want hosting that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Supports one domain</li>
  <li>Wordpress (PHP and at least one MySQL database)</li>
  <li>
    SSL (<span data-huuid="599192172878187734">Secure Sockets Layer</span> - a
    security layer that supports https)
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Where to Buy?</h2>
<p>
  That's up to you, as I don't endorse any particular shared host. Research
  options and price compare.
</p>
<p>
  Consider purchasing your domain name and hosting from the same vendor,
  otherwise, you’ll need take extra steps to have your domain name point to your
  hosting. This typically involves logging into your domain registrar (vendor
  you bought the domain from), going into <em>domain name services</em> (DNS)
  settings, and replacing the <em>nameservers</em> with an IP address you get
  from your hosting vendor.
